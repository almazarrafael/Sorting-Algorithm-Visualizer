# Sort Visualizer

## description
Sort visualizer through Python with PyQt5 GUI

## function

1. Visualizes different sorts
2. Can generate random array of numbers
3. Can generate descending array of numbers
4. Has a speed slider to change how fast/slow the sorting and generating goes

## what I learned

1. More Python practice.
2. PyQt5 for GUI.
3. QtDesigner.
4. General GUI design ideas.
5. Better understanding of sorting algorithms.
6. Some CSS.

## notes

I've been wanting to make this project for a long time now and tried to dip my feet into the world of GUI building. I first started with Tkinter for python and managed to visualize two sorts. The issue with the way I did was that it didn't have any user input at all and the sorts would visualize one after the other. It also pre-generated a random array whenever it starts and would just exit once it's done sorting. I tried a different approach by using PyQt for GUI which allowed me to use QtDesigner in order to design and flesh out the GUI then I just programmed the wanted behavior afterwards. I learned a lot about what goes into building GUIs and things that came with it such as signals from user input. I also learned a little CSS in order to make the progress bars look the way I wanted to.
